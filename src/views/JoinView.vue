            <div class="block has-text-left is-size-custom">
              Most importantly, we are looking for people who are curious about human cognition, motivated to learn new skills, and excited to contribute to a supportive lab community.

            <div class="block has-text-left is-size-custom">
              Strong applicants to the lab have research interests that are a good fit with the lab's <router-link to="/about">research program</router-link>. 
              We're excited to take our research into new directions, so we're open to a wide range of interests within cognitive and developmental psychology.
              However, most projects in our lab have some connection to learning, discovery, and/or information search.
              Being able to articulate your research interests (and how they fit with the lab's research program) is an important part of your application.
            </div>

            <div class="content has-text-left is-size-custom">
              Research in our lab draws on a variety of skills. It's helpful if you already have experience with at least some of the following:
              <ul>
                  <li>experiment design</li>
                  <li>web programming (Javascript, HTML, CSS) for developing experiments</li>
                  <li>recruiting and testing human participants</li>
                  <li>working with data and statistics</li>
                  <li>scientific communication</li>
                  <li>organization and project management</li>
              </ul>
              <i>You don't need to have experience with all of these skills to apply!</i> A big part of your PhD is learning new things, and our lab is committed to helping all lab members develop the skills they need to pursue their research interests.

            <div class="block has-text-left is-size-custom">
                Each member of our lab plays an integral role in fostering a positive lab culture.
