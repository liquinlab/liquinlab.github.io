            We are currently accepting applications for PhD students to start in Fall 2024. 
        </div>
        <div class="block has-text-left is-size-custom">
            I am committed to supporting my PhD mentees in developing their own independent research programs. My goal is to help my mentees pursue their career goals, whether in research, teaching, industry, or elsewhere.

        What we're looking for
      </div>
      <div class="block has-text-left is-size-custom">
        Most importantly, we are looking for people who are curious about human cognition, motivated to learn new skills, and excited to contribute to a supportive lab community.
      </div>

      <div class="block has-text-left is-size-custom">
        Strong applicants to the lab have research interests that are a good fit with the lab's research program. 
        We're excited to take our research into new directions, so we're open to a wide range of interests within cognitive and developmental psychology.
        However, most projects in our lab have some connection to learning, discovery, and/or information search.
        Being able to articulate your research interests (and how they fit with the lab's research program) is an important part of your application.
      </div>

      <div class="content has-text-left is-size-custom">
        Research in our lab draws on a variety of skills. It's helpful if you already have experience with at least some of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>experiment design</li>
            <li>web programming (Javascript, HTML, CSS) for developing experiments</li>
            <li>recruiting and testing human participants</li>
            <li>working with data and statistics</li>
            <li>scientific communication</li>
            <li>organization and project management</li>
        </ul>
        <i>You don't need to have experience with all of these skills to apply!</i> A big part of your PhD is learning new things, and our lab is committed to helping all lab members develop the skills they need to pursue their research interests.
      </div>
      <div class="block has-text-left is-size-custom">
          Each member of our lab plays an integral role in fostering a positive lab culture. 
          We are committed to doing rigorous, replicable research, and we promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in our lab, department, and field.
